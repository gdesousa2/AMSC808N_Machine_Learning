# AMSC808N_Project1
Project1 for AMSC808N - Machine Learning &amp; Data Science class

Data visualization and separation using various methods (SINewton, SG, ASM, etc).
Database: US election data by county from 2012 and 2016: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/US-county-demos/
Language: Matlab

Project divided in four parts:

1) Comparing SINewton vs. Soft Margins (ASM)

2) Stochastic Gradient method

3) Testing Subsample Inexact Newton Method

4) Stochastic L-BFGS method
